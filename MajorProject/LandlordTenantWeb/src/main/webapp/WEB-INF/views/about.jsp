<p>Let your fingers do the walking! Landlord Tenant System will be known for its reliability 
between two main entities- Landlords and Tenants. The application would overcome geographical 
limitations for both Landlords and Tenants in the world of housing and real estate. 
The system provides a platform for the Landlords and the tenants to communicate directly ultimately 
saving the brokerage costs. Every member as a landlord or a tenant is a subscribed member to the website.
A Tenant can search for available houses and the associated landlords in a desired area. 
Tenant can then contact landlord through details provided in the landlord's profile. 
Upon renting the property, a tenant can send maintenance requests to the landlord through the application 
with a description of the issue. He is also eligible to receive notifications from the application about 
every month’s due rent or lease termination thus saving the effort on landlord’s side. Subsequently 
he can also rate the landlord and comment on his experience with the house and the landlord; 
which would be reflected under the property listings.
A Landlord can view an individual tenant’s profile and then decide to move further with the agreement. 
Once a potential tenant has shown interest in the Landlord’s property and if the landlord chooses 
to rent his property to that tenant, the landlord can then initiate the lease agreement between 
both the parties through the Digital Leasing feature of the application that enables the landlord 
to upload a lease to the application with his e-signature following the tenant’s e-signature thereby 
storing a soft copy of the lease in the application. He can also rate and comment on an individual tenant 
which would be reflected on the corresponding tenant’s profile.</p>
